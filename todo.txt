Todo list:
    -implement proper unit testing
    -begin test driven development for everything below
    -fix bug where only a single pyvista window can render a molecule (I want multiple pyvista window rendering)
    -create unit tests for Molecule class
    -change gui layout (control_window.ui) to better reflect recent changes to code
    -begin fleshing out Protein class
        -get linear polypeptide conformation (getting an accurate folded conformation with rdkit segfaults sigma-fold :p and I want to start from linear conformation and have my physics simulation generate folded conformations)
    -create unit tests for Protein class
    -look into creating methods to pickle Molecule and Protein data
    -look into methods to deserialize pickled Molecule and Protein data
    -more unit tests for these methods
    -begin looking into MPI/CUDA libs for python (sigma-fold intends to be as modular as possible and should support both of these forms of computation for physics simulation)
