# sigma-fold
open source alphafold

ai used for some of initial gui code (llm provided some guidance on qt6, pyvista):
    -boilerplate code in ControlWindow.py, PyVistaWidget.py, some of the Visualizer constructor
    -I've deleted any llm accounts I've used because I got upset about the price increase for pc parts
    -some of the boilerplate code has been cleaned up (it was redundant)
    
libs used:
    -rdkit (small molecules)
    -qt (gui)
    -pyvista (3D visualization)
    -biopython (fasta files)
    -pytest (unit testing)
